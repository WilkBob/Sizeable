      Images are an essential part of the web. They make our websites visually
      appealing and engaging. However, images can also be a significant
      bottleneck in terms of performance. Large images can slow down your
      website, which can lead to a poor user experience and lower search engine
      rankings. This is where image optimization comes in. Image optimization is
      the process of reducing the file size of an image without sacrificing
      quality. This can help improve the performance of your website and make it
      load faster. There are many ways to optimize images, such as resizing,
      compressing, and converting them to more efficient formats. This tool
      provides a simple way to optimize your images by resizing them and
      converting them to the WebP format. Give it a try and see how it can help
      improve the performance of your website!
